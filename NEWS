Changes from 0.1 to 0.2
-----------------------

Released May 26, 2011.

New features:

- State queries from inputs to outputs.  Allows for "learning" devices
  to know the state of their destinations.

- Element-wise vector mapping.

- Removal of misleading "mapper_signal_value_t" union.  Replaced
  everywhere with void*.

- Allow setting the multicasting interface.

- Launcher to allow multiple copies of Python Slider example on OS X.

- SWIG/Python "monitor" and "db" bindings.

- JNI/Java bindings for "device" and "signal".

- Representation of "null" signal values.  (Signals are "off", or
  value is "unknown".)

- Windows support.

- Functions "midiToHz" and "hzToMidi".

- API stubs for timetag support.  Not yet implemented.

Bug fixes:

- Crash on uninitialized expressions.

- Set device name property of existing signals after initialization.

- Add input signal handlers added after initialization.

- Small memory leak in mdev_add_input.

- Remove liblo server method when signal is removed.

- Set the multicasting interface to loopback as last resort, making it
  work on Linux if not connected to network.

- Fix erroneous calculation of blocking time in mapper_monitor_poll.

- Crash when non-existant signal receives /disconnect.
